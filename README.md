# Machine Learning Project – Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a group-based machine learning course during my exchange studies at Singapore Management University.
The objective was to build and iteratively improve predictive models through data preprocessing and feature engineering.

## Project Description
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow, starting from data preprocessing and feature engineering,
through model training and evaluation. Different modeling approaches were evaluated and compared in order to
improve predictive performance in a systematic way.


## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook


Through iterative feature engineering and model evaluation, the predictive performance of the models was
gradually improved.
