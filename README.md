# Machine Learning Project – Predictive Modeling

This project was developed as part of a group-based machine learning course during my exchange studies at Singapore Management University.
The objective was to build and improve predictive models by using feature engineering. Python and scikit-learn were used in jupyter notebook. The training data is stored in the files named regression_labelled.npz and regression_unlabelled.npz, where the goal of the project is to try and assign correct labels to the unlabelled data. The project can be run by simply opening it in jupyter notebook.
